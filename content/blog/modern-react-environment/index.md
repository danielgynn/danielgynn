React is a JavaScript library, built by Facebook, for building user interfaces. React was initially built to solve the problem of building large applications with data that changes over time. React applications are built heavily with components that are able to manage their own state individually and can be composed together to build complex interfaces. React components are built with JavaScript, meaning that data is easily transported between components, without having to be managed by the DOM.

One of the many arguments against using React is that it there are a large number of tools and libraries available to run a simple web app, which sometimes leads to [JavaScript fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.ewz94dk6v). However, one of my favourite things about React is that you can make it as light-weight as you need, without having to include unnecessary tooling, yet are still able to build powerful applications. Then you are able to add a bunch of cool things on top of your apps, where it is needed - for example, adding Sass adding improved functionality to your CSS.

This article will serve as the first of a short series of React tutorials, designed to allow the reader to build and maintain complex React applications simply and gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts of React and the modern JavaScript development environment tools it uses. This first post will focus purely on getting a development environment up and running.

## Required Tools and Prerequisites

We will be using a variety of tools to configure our modern React development environment, including:
