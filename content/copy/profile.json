    "introduction": "Hey there — I'm a frontend engineer and product designer with over four years of professional experience and a degree in computer science. I mostly specialise in React/Redux stacks, but I also have experience with Vue, Angular, and Ember.js. I've worked in various industries, including: artificial intelligence, healthcare, and genomics. I became involved in frontend engineering as the perfect way to blend my interests in engineering principles and utilising my keen eye for design.",
